  "Overview": "<p>\n\tWelcome to a wonderful gated residential enclave of just 248 plots spread across 39 sylvan acres. Brilliantly designed, with plot sizes ranging from 267 to 2077 square yards, each fully Vaastu compliant, Prestige Nirvana promises you a life of unending ease and splendor. Prestige Nirvana captures the imagination right from the moment you enter. As you sweep in through the grand and wide entry gates, you are immediately treated to the view of the sprawling central park whose rippling mounds and greens make for an imposing spectacle. A combination of 60 ft. and 40 ft. wide roads intersecting perpendicularly ensures that your home is always readily accessible, no matter where in the enclave it is located. The roads are cycle-friendly and designed to avoid traffic congestions in any area.What&rsquo;s more, the trees lining the roads have been selected in such a way that every street will be seen flowering in a different colour with each passing month of the year. Well planned open spaces such as play areas, open grounds and parks, and walking trails all add up to promote a healthy and fulfilled lifestyle. All the essential connections like water supply through overhead tank, electrical and sanitary connections will be drawn till each plot, to offer plug and play linkage. Besides, the underground power cabling, sewerage network and water harvesting structures are a standard feature. Finally, Prestige Nirvana is strategically located in Rajendranagar, putting you within ready reach of all civic needs and amenities.\n</p>\n",

  "Overview": "<p>\n\tPrestige Eden Garden is planned as a blissful residential community set within an acre, located on NH&nbsp;544, at Kalamasserry, Kochi. It consists of 112 finely crafted premium units, which is a combination of 4&nbsp;bedroom units and 3 bedroom units.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe architectural intent is to establish a high quality environment and create a sense of place and identity&nbsp;for the development through the creative use of landscape and placement of built structure. The building&nbsp;being set deeper into the property, aids to provide lush landscape that announces one&rsquo;s arrival at Eden&nbsp;Garden and provide a tranquil experience away from the bustle of the main road.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe tower is massed in such a manner that all the units have two or more faces externally which in turn allows for natural light and ventilation to all the habitable spaces as well as encourages cross ventilation. The character of the building is strongly defined by the clean lines which provide a contemporary look and feel to the development.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn order to ensure the privacy of the residents, there is a clear distinction in the way public and semipublic&nbsp;areas of the Club facilities are laid. The Multipurpose Hall is kept at the ground level, which spills out&nbsp;to large deck surrounded by landscape on the periphery. While facilities like the Gym, Indoor Games,&nbsp;Mini Theatre and the Swimming Pool which are exclusively for the residents, have been accommodated&nbsp;at the Sky Deck level which is on the rooftop whilst allowing for fabulous views externally.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPrestige Eden Garden is located within driving distance of well-reputed educational institutions, shopping&nbsp;malls, hospitals and hotels. It is on the Metro route and the Cochin International Airport is a 30-minute&nbsp;drive away. The scenic Container Terminal Road is also close by\n</p>\n",

  "Long_description": "Prestige Eden Garden is planned as a blissful residential community set within an acre, located on NH 544, at Kalamasserry, Kochi. It consists of 112 finely crafted premium units, which is a combination of 4 bedroom units and 3 bedroom units.\n\nThe architectural intent is to establish a high quality environment and create a sense of place and identity for the development through the creative use of landscape and placement of built structure. The building being set deeper into the property, aids to provide lush landscape that announces one’s arrival at Eden Garden and provide a tranquil experience away from the bustle of the main road.\n\nThe tower is massed in such a manner that all the units have two or more faces externally which in turn allows for natural light and ventilation to all the habitable spaces as well as encourages cross ventilation. The character of the building is strongly defined by the clean lines which provide a contemporary look and feel to the development.\n\nIn order to ensure the privacy of the residents, there is a clear distinction in the way public and semipublic areas of the Club facilities are laid. The Multipurpose Hall is kept at the ground level, which spills out to large deck surrounded by landscape on the periphery. While facilities like the Gym, Indoor Games, Mini Theatre and the Swimming Pool which are exclusively for the residents, have been accommodated at the Sky Deck level which is on the rooftop whilst allowing for fabulous views externally.\n\nPrestige Eden Garden is located within driving distance of well-reputed educational institutions, shopping malls, hospitals and hotels. It is on the Metro route and the Cochin International Airport is a 30-minute drive away. The scenic Container Terminal Road is also close by",

As the development is positioned ideally at the juncture of the three National Highways (NH 47, NH 49, NH 47A), it provides an easy access to Cochin International Airport, Kakkanad Info Park and MG Road. Apart from the easy conveyance with the Kochi Metro being just 3 kms away, the area is also quite famous for its string of international car showrooms.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tKeeping in tune with their distinctively incredible landscaping, Prestige Cityscape is a sure beauty.

As the development is positioned ideally at the juncture of the three National Highways (NH 47, NH 49, NH 47A), it provides an easy access to Cochin International Airport, Kakkanad Info Park and MG Road. Apart from the easy conveyance with the Kochi Metro being just 3 kms away, the area is also quite famous for its string of international car showrooms.\n\nKeeping in tune with their distinctively incredible landscaping, Prestige Cityscape is a sure beauty. Come, revel in its comfort and conveniences and bask in the lap of luxury.",

Presenting a plethora of sizes and configurations, from two-bed homes with study, to three-bed homes with study and servant&rsquo;s room and plenty in between. You can thus opt for the home that most closely aligns with your needs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tLife at Prestige Woodland Park promises to be one of unblemished comfort and convenience. Everything you need to keep your days moving smoothly and your nights go with a swing are within ready reach. Cooke Town is a well established neighbourhood and is home to plenty of shops, restaurants, parks and services of all types. In any case, it is a mere three to four kilometres from Bangalore&rsquo;s premier shopping districts such as Commercial Street, MG Road and Brigade Road. The Cox Town market is a short walk away, while the Russell Market is a ten minute drive. Educational institutions of repute within a radius of two to three kilometres include Clarence High school, St. Francis Xavier&rsquo;s Girl&rsquo;s High School, St. Germain&rsquo;s Boy&rsquo;s High School and CMR National Public School. The locality abounds with places of worship of all faiths: the Haji Sir Ismail Sait Mosque and the Holy Ghost Church are a five minute drive, while churches of other denominations are within walking distance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe historic Banaswadi Hanuman Temple is again just ten minutes away.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYour leisure hours will be gainfully occupied here as befits a person of your lifestyle and tastes. The Clubhouse at Prestige Woodland Park is fully equipped with a Gymnasium, Ladies and Gentlemen&rsquo;s Health Clubs, a Squash Court, a Billiards table, a Table Tennis table, a spacious Party Hall, a Swimming Pool and a Kids&rsquo; Pool. For your added convenience, there is also provision for facilities like a Laundromat.\n</p>\n",
